## Overview

These docs cover our [methodology](https://docs.omora.com/getting-started/methodology), [core principles](https://docs.omora.com/core-principles/a-primer), and [tech stack](https://docs.omora.com/stack/overview). Together they form the building blocks of our approach to finance. If we succeed in explaining it, you will reach the end of it having the necessary foundations to build production-grade finance pipelines, dashboards, and analytics on top of your software and tools. 

No vendor lock-in. No 7 months implementations. <br/>
Just a little code. Cream. And perhaps AI.

Theory is part of the recipe, certainly. But if we don't put the books down and get our hands dirty, that yields zero. Hence, we share - together with these docs - projects and a playground for you to put this knowledge into practice. 

We want to show you how to really bake the cake.
