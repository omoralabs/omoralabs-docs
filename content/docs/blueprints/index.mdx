## What are Blueprints?

Blueprints are **pre-built workflows** that show how Semantic Layers, Workers, and Transformations work together. They let you **quickly deploy end-to-end processes** for reporting and analytics without starting from scratch, so you can see best practices in action and adapt them to your own data.  

Think of them as **ready-to-use blueprints** for clean, automated, and reliable data pipelines.
