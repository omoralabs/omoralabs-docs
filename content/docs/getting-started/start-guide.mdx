[Omora Labs](https://www.omoralabs.com) helps finance teams becoming fast-moving ones by building finance systems the way software is built: composable, versioned, and production ready.

If you are used to spreadsheets, fragile BI tools, or month-end bottlenecks, this documentation will show a different way to design finance.

This guide introduces how Omora Labs thinks about finance infrastructure and how to explore real implementations through projects and hands-on playgrounds.

Let's get started.

## How to Read These Docs

These docs are not product documentaiton.

They explain principles, architecture, and patterns used to build modern finance systems.

Use them to understand:

- How to design finance workflows as software
- How data flows from source systems to reporting systems
- Where automation and AI add leverage and where they don't



### Understand the Principles

Before tools, there are principles.

The [Core Principles](/core-principles/a-primer) section explains the non-negotiables behind every Omora Labs piece of work

import { Wallet, Diff, ArrowLeftRight, Play, Compass, Zap } from 'lucide-react';
import { Banner } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/banner';

### Learn the Stack

Modern finance build in specialised tools for each part of the workflow.

The [Stack & Tools](/stack/overview) section explains the role each layer plays. Compute and analytics, warehouses, orchestration, modeling, reporting, and the AI layer.

### Explore Real Projects

See how these ideas look in practice through real-world implementations.

[Projects](/next/projects-overview) showcase complete finance workflows versioned and automated using modern data stacks. From data ingestion to reporting, including tradeoffs, constraints, and outcomes.

</Cards>

### Try It Hands-On

Experience the workflows interactively.

The [Playground](/next/playground) lets you explore pipelines, transformations, and reporting logic in a safe, editable environment. Nothing is deployed. Nothing breaks. You're free to experiment.
