## What are Semantic Layers?

<Callout>
    The semantic layers are implemented purely in SQL, with <a href="https://duckdb.org/" target="_blank">DuckDB</a> as the reference engine, making them portable across different database providers.
</Callout>

Semantic Layers define the **core business concepts** — such as Dates, GL Accounts, Business Units, Revenue Types, Revenue Changes, and Value Types — in a single, authoritative place. They encode hierarchies, classifications, and business meaning, ensuring all data, calculations, and reports speak the same language.

They are the **contract definitions** for your organization’s data.
