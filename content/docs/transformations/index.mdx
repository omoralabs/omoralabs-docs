</Callout>

Transformations are processes that prepare raw data for reporting, so you can simply query it and get clean, structured, and ready-to-use results. They enforce business logic, clean inconsistencies, and organize data into tables or views that analysts and finance teams can rely on without extra manipulation.

Think of them as the preparation step that makes reporting effortless and reliable.
