title: Cash Balances by RC
description: Aggregates converted asset values into total cash balances per reporting currency and date.
---

export const table_name = "cash_balances_byrc"
export const caption = "Total cash balances expressed in reporting currencies."

## Purpose

Provide a **reporting-level aggregation of cash balances**, expressed in standardized reporting currencies.

This model collapses all converted asset values into a single total per reporting currency and time period, making it suitable for:
- Net worth reporting
- Cash position tracking
- Executive dashboards and summaries

It represents the **final consumption layer** for asset-based cash balances.

## Business Logic

- Start from the [Assets Converted](/transformations/assets-converted) transformations
- Group converted asset values by:
  - Date
  - ISO week
  - Reporting currency
- Aggregate values using `SUM`
- Round final balances to two decimal places
- Produce one row per reporting currency per date

## Output Contract
