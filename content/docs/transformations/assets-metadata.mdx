title: Assets Metadata
description: Provides a simplified view of asset metadata, including asset providers and operating currencies.
---

export const table_name = "assets_metadata"
export const caption = "Asset providers mapped to their operating currency."

## Purpose

Provides a simplified view of asset metadata.

This model exists to translate internal currency identifiers into standardized ISO currency codes, so downstream models can work with currencies without re-implementing joins or lookup logic.

It is intentionally minimal and acts as a **currency resolution layer** for asset providers.

## Business Logic

- Start from the [Asset Providers](/semantic-layers/assets-providers) source table
- Join each asset provider to its configured currency
- Translate internal currency IDs into [ISO currency codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) using the [Currencies](/semantic-layers/currencies) semantic contract.
- Expose a stable, reusable contract for downstream facts

## Output Contract
### Definitions

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| asset_provider | Name of the asset provider (e.g. Stripe, HSBC, Coinbase) |
| account_id | Asset provider identifier |
| currency | [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) associated with the provider |


### Sample & Implementation

  <RenderTable csvPath={`registry/transformations/models/intermediate/${table_name}.csv`} caption={caption}>
      <ReadComponents filePath={`registry/transformations/models/intermediate/${table_name}.sql`}/>
  </RenderTable>

## Dependencies

- Semantic Layers: [Assets Providers](/semantic-layers/assets-providers) and [Currencies](/semantic-layers/currencies)
