title: Assets Values
description: Combines asset metadata with dated asset values into a consumable fact view.
---

export const table_name = "assets_values"
export const caption = "Asset values enriched with provider and currency metadata."

## Purpose

Provide a **fully enriched, time-aware view of assets**, combining asset metadata with their corresponding dated values.

This model joins asset-level amounts to their provider and currency context, producing a ready-to-use dataset for reporting, aggregation, and downstream financial analysis.

It serves as the **asset fact view**, avoiding repeated joins between asset values and metadata across the stack.

## Business Logic

- Start from the [Assets Metadata](/transformations/assets-metadata) transformations
- Join asset metadata to [Assets](/facts/assets) value facts by `asset_id`
- Derive ISO week number from the asset date
- Normalize missing asset values to zero

## Output Contract
### Definitions

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| date | Date of the asset value (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Links to [Dates](/semantic-layers/dates) |
| weeknum | [ISO year-week](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) in `YYYYWW` format, derived from `date` |
| asset_provider | Name of the asset provider (e.g. Stripe, HSBC, Coinbase) |
| asset_id | Asset unique identifier |
| currency | [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) associated with the asset |
| amount | Asset value for the given date (defaults to `0` if missing) |
