title: Assets Converted
description: Converts aggregated asset values into reporting currencies using standardized exchange rates.
---

export const table_name = "assets_converted"
export const caption = "Asset values converted into reporting currencies."

## Purpose

Provide a **reporting-ready view of asset values converted into reporting currencies**.

This model takes pre-aggregated asset amounts by currency and date and applies standardized exchange rates to express those values in one or more reporting currencies. It enables consolidated reporting, net worth calculations, and cross-currency comparisons.

All conversion logic is centralized here so downstream models do not need to handle exchange rates or conversion rules.

## Business Logic

- Start from the aggregated [Assets by Currency](/transformations/assets-by-currency) transformation
- Cross join with the [Currencies](/semantic-layers/currencies) semantic layer to generate reporting currencies
- Join to [Reporting Rates](/transformations/reporting-rates) to retrieve applicable exchange rates
- Apply currency conversion logic:
  - If asset currency equals reporting currency, use the original amount
  - Otherwise, multiply by the applicable exchange rate
- Round converted values to two decimal places

## Output Contract
### Definitions

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| date | Date of the asset snapshot (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| weeknum | ISO year-week in `YYYYWW` format, derived from `date` |
| currency | Source [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) of the asset |
| amount | Total asset amount in the source currency |
| reporting_currency | Target [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) used for reporting |
| conversion_rate | Exchange rate applied from `currency` to `reporting_currency` |
| converted_value | Asset value expressed in the reporting currency |
